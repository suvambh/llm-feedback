        "content": "User input in Python is how you gather data from the user while the program is running. The `input()` function is used to prompt the user for information. It pauses the program and waits for the user to type something and press Enter. The entered data is returned as a string, which you can then convert to other types like integer or float, depending on your needs.\n\nFor example, `input(\"Enter a number: \")` displays the prompt, and the user can enter a response. You can convert the response into a number with `int()` or `float()`, like so: `num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))`. Here's a brief illustration:\n\n```python\nnumber = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))  # Prompts user for a number\nprint(f\"You entered: {number}\")  # Outputs the entered number\n```"

        "content": "The output part of your Python program is where you display results or messages to the user. You can use the `print()` function to show information in the console. \n\nFor example, if you want to output the result of a calculation, you can use:\n\n```python\nresult = add(num1, num2)  # Assuming num1 and num2 are numbers you calculated with\nprint(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `print()` function outputs the string \"The result is: \" followed by the value of `result`. You can format the output using f-strings (like shown), which allow you to directly embed variables within the string. This makes it clear and easy to read when displaying information to the user."
