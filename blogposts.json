    "content": "# NLTK Tutorial: Integrating with PyTorch for Text Classification\n\nIf you're looking to get started with Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) combined with PyTorch can be a powerful combination. This tutorial will guide you through a simple text classification task that leverages both libraries.\n\n### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries\n\nFirst, you'll need to install NLTK and PyTorch. You can do this using the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install nltk torch torchvision\n```\n\n### Step 2: Import Libraries\n\nNext, import the necessary libraries in your Python script:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\n```\n\n### Step 3: Prepare Your Data\n\nUse NLTK for tokenization and prepare a simple dataset for your classification model. Here\u2019s how to start:\n\n```python\nnltk.download('punkt')\n\n# Sample data\ntexts = [\"I love programming\", \"Python is great\", \"I hate bugs\"]\nlabels = [1, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative\n\n# Tokenization\ntokenized_texts = [word_tokenize(text.lower()) for text in texts]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create a Custom Dataset Class\n\nDefine a Dataset class to load your tokenized texts along with their corresponding labels. This will facilitate batching and shuffling during training.\n\n```python\nclass TextDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, texts, labels):\n        self.texts = texts\n        self.labels = labels\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.labels)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        return self.texts[idx], self.labels[idx]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Set Up Your Model\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's define a basic model using PyTorch. \n\n```python\nclass SimpleNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()\n        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2) # Adjust input size accordingly\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.fc(x)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith these steps, you\u2019ve laid the groundwork for using NLTK with PyTorch for text classification.
