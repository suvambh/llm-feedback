ETFs typically track the performance of a specific index or sector, allowing investors to buy shares in a diversified portfolio with ease. They offer benefits like lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds, tax efficiency, and the ability to trade throughout the day at market prices.

This can be achieved through strategies that reduce taxable events, such as capital gains and dividend distributions. For example, certain investment vehicles, like ETFs, tend to trigger fewer taxable events compared to mutual funds due to their unique structure and the way they are bought and sold. Tax-efficient investments aim to maximize after-tax returns, allowing investors to keep more of their profits. Understanding tax implications can help investors strategically plan their portfolios for better overall performance."

They are trained on vast datasets and can perform a variety of language tasks, such as translation, summarization, and question-answering. Popular examples include OpenAI's GPT series and Google's BERT. Their effectiveness stems from their architecture, typically based on transformers, which allow them to capture intricate patterns in language. Learning about LLMs involves exploring topics like natural language processing, neural networks, and ethical considerations in AI usage."

It also supports integration with other libraries and tools, enhancing its capabilities for more complex NLP tasks. NLTK is widely used in academic and educational settings for both beginners and advanced users in the field of natural language processing."
